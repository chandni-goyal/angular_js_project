# angular_js_project
Just start with angular js/Basics

Install the Angular CLI globally.

To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:

content_copy
npm install -g @angular/cli

To create a new workspace and initial starter app:

Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name my-app, as shown here:

content_copy
ng new my-app

The Angular CLI includes a server, so that you can easily build and serve your app locally.

Go to the workspace folder (my-app).

Launch the server by using the CLI command ng serve, with the --open option.

content_copy
cd my-app
ng serve --open
